# capstone-service-layer
 This repository will house files related to the service layer of my DT Tracker web application.

 Purpose of the Application:
The purpose of the DT Tracker is to assist Developmental Therapists in tracking their attendance percentages for individual children on 
their caseload as well as their caseload as a whole. Funding for Developmental Therapy is contingent upon maintaining an attendance percentage rate of at or above seventy-five percent. The DT Tracker will make tracking attendance far more efficient. 

 The Role of this Project:
This project plays an important role within the DT Tracker web application as the service layer determines the application's operations. The service layer will help to form which requests will be sent in order to enter, update, delete, and view data from the database. This is extremely important in regards to the DT Tracker web application as the application's primary focus is to give the user an all encompassing web application that allows them to view caseload and schedule information, input session data, and view attendance percentages.
